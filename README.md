The project name is emergencysos.It's a website that allows users to hack into the emergency numbers of a country of their choosing.
a link to the deployed site is on https://vercel.com/mbaruku-jembes-projects/portifolioproject2-bsrb
it is mostly designed for users who dont know the emergency numbers for East African countries for example firefighting services, Place services or ambulance services.
The main reason for creating the project is that once i was in Tanzania doing a job in the transit trucks sector as a turnboy.On a certain day during the night an overspeeding truck overtook us and hit the side mirror of the vehicle.the driver had to immediately park the truck on the left side of the vehicle.However even thugh we were alive we started seing bits of the other truck on the road and finally spotted it on a valley side.Seing them we decided to call for help from them but no one was around, it dwelled on us that it was either us or no one.Being Kenyans in another country, we knew little about the emergency number from this country and so we had to know how to help th guys
The truck was completely in shreds.There was not an ounce of life left about for one to see from the truck.You could not even tell wheather there was ayone in the truck.Hello we said no response, Hello again, still n response, at this moment, we heard a faint response 'Tuko hapa(we are here)'.We then spotted 3 men in the cabin.Trully speaking if i had to tell you how we had to save the guy you wouldnt beleive me, so let me not just tell you.
Remembering the incidence and multiple other incidents of the road ive seen as a turnboy in the transit sector, i had to create a wbsite that will enable one be able to get eergency numbers from whichever country no matter what.Thats when i decided to create emergencysos:<img width="948" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/853a1171-4570-4d2d-a319-262a068e0ba5">
with this site i know that many emergencies will be dealt with as early as possible no matter what.an example of a country I provided for the project is Tanzania:
